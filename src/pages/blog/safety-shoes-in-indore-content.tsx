        In the bustling industrial hubs of Indore, Pithampur, and Dewas, workplace safety isn't just a regulation—it's a fundamental necessity. For over 70 years, Paras Sales Corporation has been committed to the well-being of the local workforce, providing reliable and certified safety footwear. We understand that the right pair of shoes is the first line of defense against workplace hazards.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Understanding Safety Standards (ISI, EN ISO)</h2>
      <p>
        When selecting safety shoes, you'll often see certifications like ISI (Indian Standards Institute) and EN ISO 20345. These aren't just labels; they are a guarantee of protection.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
        <li><strong>ISI Mark:</strong> This confirms that the shoes meet the standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), ensuring they have passed rigorous quality and safety tests.</li>
        <li><strong>EN ISO 20345:</strong> This is the European standard for safety footwear. It specifies basic and additional requirements for shoes designed to protect the wearer from injuries that could occur in the workplace. Key features tested include impact resistance, compression resistance, and slip resistance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a local business, we ensure that the footwear we provide adheres to these critical standards, giving you and your team peace of mind.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Types of Safety Hazards & Corresponding Shoes</h2>
      <p>
        The industrial landscape of our region presents unique challenges. Here’s a breakdown of common risks and the footwear designed to combat them:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
        <li><strong>Heavy Machinery & Falling Objects:</strong> In construction and manufacturing, the risk of impact is high. <strong>Steel-toe or Composite-toe boots</strong> are essential to protect against compression and crushing injuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Slippery Floors:</strong> Oily or wet surfaces are common in workshops and factory floors. Shoes with <strong>anti-skid or slip-resistant soles</strong> provide the necessary traction to prevent falls.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Hazards:</strong> For electricians or maintenance staff working near live circuits, <strong>EH (Electrical Hazard)-rated footwear</strong> is crucial. These boots are designed to impede the flow of electricity, providing a secondary source of protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharp Objects:</strong> Puncture wounds from nails, scrap metal, or glass are a serious risk on construction sites. Look for shoes with a <strong>puncture-resistant midsole plate</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
